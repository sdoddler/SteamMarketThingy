				What is it?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program was created to help manage and view Steam Inventories & Items.

-It gathers data from both the Steam Market JSONs and Steam WebAPI.
-It allows users to view the associated content for each item: Float Value, Icon, 
Wallpaper & Link to website(or wiki) or to inspect in game. As well as displaying 
the current market value.

-It can also display a price history graph for items (further back than 30 days)
-And allows users to filter and display items per AppID, Only Marketable items and/or
only Tradeable items.
-Users can also add how much they bought the item for in $ or Keys.

				Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Program runs as a standalone executable (.exe) and should run on most Windows
devices. Osias has tested and confirmed it works on Windows 10 however there
may be some compatibility issues - let me know if you experience anything.

The Program creates a IniFiles Folder & a Settings.ini in the same Directory as 
the executeable (I would put the Executeable in a folder wherever you like then
shortcut it.)

The Program also stores some files in AppData\SteamMarketThingy such as the
.ico files and the Images downloaded from the steam Servers. The temporary .JSON
files are also stored here however they are normally deleted as soon as they are
used within the program (instantaneous).

				Source
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have included the source files for anyone else to take a look at and use if they
can. Apologies in advance for my poor coding standards\practices.
There is only one EXCLUSION from the source code which is my webAPIKey. (variable:
$webAPIKey = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX in the source code)
As Steam requires users to signup for a webAPIKey via their website:
http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
Due to the fact that it is unique to everyone I think this could be exploited if
left in the source code.
